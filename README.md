# Chess-Opening-Practicer
This is a side project creating a javascript program to practice chess openings.

The idea is to allow the user to import pgn chess notation for chess openings and the program will quiz the user on what moves
they should play based on the imported pgn.  

I always had issues remembering opening moves and theory by just mindlessly playing them in opening explorers from youtube videos 
or books.  The purpose of this program is to allow the user to better practice openings that engages the user more.

This program is also being used as my introduction to javascript and learn the language
